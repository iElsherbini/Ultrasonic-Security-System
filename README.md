## Supplies
* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Arduino
* Resistor 
* Buzzer 
* wires 
* Led 
* Breadboard
## Description
Connect a red wire from the 5v pin on the Arduino to the positive channel of the breadboard. Connect a black wire from the GND pin on the Arduino to the negative channel of the breadboard:
* Buzzer: pin 2
* Echo: pin 12
* Trig: pin 13
* Redled: pin 9,8 
* Yellowled: pin 7,6,5
* Greenled: pin 4,3

The green wires connected to the Leds “positive side”, while the negative side connected to the negative channel of the breadboard using a resistor. Connect the Gnd pin on the ultrasonic sensor to the negative 
channel on the breadboard. Next connect the Trig pin on the sensor to pin 13 and connect the Echo to pin 12 on Arduino.Lastly, Connect the vcc to the positive channel and the longer leg of the buzzer to pin 2 using a grey wire 
and then connect the shorter leg of the buzzer to the negative channel on the breadboard.
